# Fern
This was a project I worked on for 159.333 - Independant Programming Project at Massey University.

Fern is a mood tracking application for iOS and watchOS.

The application is incomplete, the purpose of the paper was to get experience working on a reasonably complex piece of software, and combined with a 30 page project report, this project got an A.
